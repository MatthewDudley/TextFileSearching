Git Tips:       **   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE   **

1. Instal Git
    Open your command line or terminal type: git --version to make sure you have it installed


To get the project repository on you computer:
    Click on CSCI3230-Project-2017 on Github.com
    Click the GREEN button on the right "Clone or download"
    Copy the HTTPS link

    ** I would make a new directory on your computer for GitProjects **

    Open Command Line or Terminal
        Go into your new directory (if you made one) or go into where ever you want your folder to be type:
            cd [folder name]  
        Type: git clone "paste link" -  ** paste the link inside double quotes ** 
            this will put the entire project on you computer, you should now have the 
            folder on you computer with all the files from the project
            
        
    Now you can open the project in Visual Studio or whatever IDE you want to use.
    When you save a file to the folder on your computer use the commands to sync it with GitHub.

        git status
        git add <filename> or git add *
        git commit -m "Message here"
        git push

        ** git commands only work when you are in the same directory as the project, see below **
        ** folow that order to add files to the GitHub project, add, commit, push  **
