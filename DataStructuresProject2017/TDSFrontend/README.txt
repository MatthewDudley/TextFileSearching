The Frontend of our project houses the GUI design and drives the information retrevial process. 
Our GUI design is simple for the user to input a word or string in the text box and search our text 
documents for a match. When displaying the results we preform a simularity test on the matching documents 
to see which one mathces the user's search best and display from matching the most to matching the least. 
After the matching documents are displayed the user can simply click the hyperlinked text document name 
and the document will open.
